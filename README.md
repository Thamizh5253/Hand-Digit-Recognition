# Overview
This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset. The project consists of two main parts:

## 1)Model Building:
In this phase, a neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## 2)Testing and Deployment: 

After training the model, it is saved and deployed to recognize handwritten digits from images. A separate script is provided to load the saved model and test it on user-provided images.

## Requirements
**Libraries and Installations:**
    
ðŸ“Œ**TensorFlow**

ðŸ“Œ**NumPy**

ðŸ“Œ**OpenCV (cv2)**

ðŸ“Œ**Matplotlib**

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
  pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```


## Files
The project consists of two main Python files:

## model.py: 
This file contains the code for building, training, and saving the handwritten digit recognition model.
## main.py: 
This file contains the code for loading the saved model and testing it on user-provided images.
## Usage
### Building the Model 
ðŸ“ŒRun the model.py script to build and train the model on the MNIST dataset.

ðŸ“Œ The trained model will be saved as handwritten.model in the current directory.
### Testing and Deployment
ðŸ“ŒDraw a digit (0-9) on a canvas of size 28x28 pixels using any drawing tool like MS Paint.

ðŸ“ŒSave the image as a PNG file in the digitsImg1 directory with a filename like 1.png, 2.png, etc.

ðŸ“ŒRun the model.py script to load the saved model and test it on the handwritten digit images saved in the digitsImg1 directory.

ðŸ“ŒThe script will display the predicted digit along with the image for each saved image.

## Model Architecture
The neural network model used for this project consists of the following layers:

**Input Layer:**
Flatten layer to reshape the input images to a 1D array (28x28 = 784 pixels).

**Hidden Layer 1:**
 Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function.
Hidden Layer 2: Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function.

**Output Layer:** Dense layer with 10 neurons (corresponding to digits 0-9) and softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

## Notes
ðŸ“ŒEnsure that the images saved in the digitsImg1 directory are 28x28 pixels grayscale images.

ðŸ“ŒThe model's performance can vary based on the quality and clarity of the handwritten digits in the images.

ðŸ“ŒBy following the instructions above, you can build, test, and deploy a handwritten digit recognition model using deep learning techniques.
